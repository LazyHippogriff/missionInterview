* Way to represent design of database

3 things:

1. Entity Set e.g. students, teachers, course. Represented using rectangles. Weak entity sets represented by double rectangles.
2. Relationship Set e.g. teaches, gives, joins. represented by diamonds and weak relationship sets represented by double diamonds.
3. Attributes: Entity/Relationship can have attributes like name, age in case of entity student and date, place in case of relationship joins. Represented by ovals. Double ovals are used to represent multi-valued attributes e.g. mobile number. Dotted ovals used for derived attributes e.g. age can be derived from DOB attribute.
Key attribute eg. aadhar number of a person is represented by oval and underline.

Attributes can be: composite(eg. name is composed of first name and last name)


Relationship sets can have degrees e.g.
unary e.g. employee 'manages' employee, person is 'married' to a person
binary e.g. student 'attends' a course, supplier 'supplies' items, professor 'teaches' subjects. Binary relationships are the most common.
n-ary e.g. professor entity, student entity, project entity can have n-ary relationship. 


Cardinality

How many entities from each side participate in a relationship

one to one e.g. 1 driver can 'drive' 1 car, 1 person 'can have' 1 aadhar
one to many e.g. 1 teacher 'teaches' many courses.
many to many e.g. m students can study n subjects, x customers can buy y products


Total participation
Every entity on one side of a relationship participates in the relationship e.g. students in a college 'study' courses. Total participation are stored by double lines connecting entity set rectangle with the relationship set diamoned.

Weak entity sets do not have a primary key e.g. the entity 'section' (section in school) is weak entity set. Weak entities always show total participation.
