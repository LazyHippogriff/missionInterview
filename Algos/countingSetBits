*** Main Concept ***

number of set Bits in x =  (last bit is set ? 1 : 0) + number of set Bits in x/2

We can precompute the number of set Bits in x for all x between 0 to 255 and then we can use this precomputation while processing the given number in chunks of 8 bits.

*** Slightly less efficient concept ***

If number of set bits in x = n

then we can compute n in Theta(n) time by this:

int count = 0;
while(x != 0) {
x = x & (x-1); //This operation will set all bits towards the right of the first set bit as zero(including the set bit)
++count;
}
