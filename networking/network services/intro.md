There are a lot of network services and technologies that are used to help make computer networking more user friendly and secure. These network services and technologies, are ones that directly relate to the business of networking itself, and it's important to understand how those work. If something on the network
isn't working as expected, the first place you should look at are the services we'll be covering here. 

By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe why name resolution is important, identify the many steps involved with the DNS lookup, and understand the most
common DNS record types. You'll also be able to explain DHCP makes network administration a simpler task. You'll be able to demonstrate how NAT technologies help keep networks secure and help preserve precious IP address space. Finally you'll be able to describe how VPNs and proxies help users get connected and stay secure. As you can see we've got a lot to tackle so let's get started.
