From a very basic standpoint, a router is a network device that forwards traffic depending on the destination address of that traffic. A router is a device that has at least two network interfaces, since it has to be connected to two networks to do its job. 

Basic routing has just a few steps. 

One, a router receives a packet of data on one of its interfaces. 

Two, the router examines the destination IP of this packet. 

Three, the router then looks up the destination network of this IP in its routing table. 

Four, the router forwards that out though the interface that's closest to the remote network. It also decrements TTL, recalculates the checksum and puts its MAC address in ethernet frame. 

These steps are repeated as often as needed until the traffic reaches its destination.
